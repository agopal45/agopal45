### Featured Project: Money Parce

One of my proudest achievements is [Money Parce](https://github.com/imermigkas3/MoneyParce), a full-stack group project designed to help students track their finances. Built using Python and the Django framework, our team implemented 20+ user stories over two 2-week sprints, gaining hands-on experience in Agile and Scrum methodologies.
This application is deployed and can be accessed here:
